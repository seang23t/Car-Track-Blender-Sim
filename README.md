# Car-Track-Blender-Sim
Final Year Project on making a simulation of a car around a track

This is my Final Year Project on using Blender to show a car moving around a track using accurate physics and real track measurements. It is intended to give an idea of how fast a car can travel around a track. The variables are sat at the top of the script to make them easily editable and let you experiment with what different values do to a car and how quick it takes a track. The track used is Mondello's short track.

Future improvents include:
Making the movement smooth (not jumping from point to point)
Adding a ground around the track and adding trees (important to give sense of speed)
Positioning the camera behind the car correctly
Making a plugin so the variables of the car are easier to access instead of being hidden in the script section
